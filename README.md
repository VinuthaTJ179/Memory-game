In this game a user will be given a limited time of 3 milliseconds initially, to memorize the positions of related objects based on color and shapes.
Upon correctly identifying all of them, the user is considered to have won the game.

To play this game onto your system, install python and its module pygame using "pip install pygame".

This project was taught from a project course from Coursera.
